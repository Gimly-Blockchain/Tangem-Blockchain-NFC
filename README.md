# Tangem made for blockchain NFC
With Tangem made-for-blockchain NFC chips, physical objects and beings can interact securely and directly with digital blockchains. No third layer, cloud service, or back-end needed for key management and signature generation. The private key is securely generated within the chip, cannot be extracted, and is used to sign blockchain transactions directly from the chip. Contrary to other crypto tags, Tangem made-for-blockchain NFC chips do not only allow for authentication through challenge response schemes, but they can sign multiple types of transactions directly from the chip. They offer a wide range of additional functions, and are available as physical cards, tags or stickers. With their different form factors and broad functionality, they open up a wide range of use cases, including anti-counterfeiting, supply chain and logistics, and identity solutions.

## Functionalities
* Blockchain transactions: sign directly from the chip, raw/hashed/single/arrays of transactions
* Support sec256k1 and ed25519 cryptographic curves. 
* Authenticity: prove product and chip authenticity through challenge response.
* Data storage: sign and store encrypted or raw data on chip.
* 2FA: allow only transactions or data validated through issuer signature.
* Other security functions: Security delays, PIN codes, CVC codes.
* EAL6+ certified secure smart-card chip based on ARM SC000 core architecture and having ISO14443 Type A contactless interface.
